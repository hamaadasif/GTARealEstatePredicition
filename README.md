# GTA Real Estate Prediction

## Overview
The GTA Real Estate Prediction project is a Python-based analysis tool for predicting real estate prices in Toronto. It utilizes data science techniques to project future real estate prices based on historical data.

## Features
- **Data Analysis**: Performs data analysis on real estate prices in Toronto.
- **Price Projection**: Projects future real estate prices based on the number of bedrooms and age of properties.
- **Visualization**: Generates visualizations to represent projected price trends over the next decade.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for linear regression and other machine learning tasks

## How It Works
1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: The script starts by loading and cleaning the real estate data, focusing on properties in Toronto.
2. **Data Analysis**: Analyzes price distributions and removes outliers.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Adds relevant features like property age.
4. **Data Visualization**: Projects future prices and visualizes them.

## Setup and Running
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure Python and required packages (`pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn`, `matplotlib`) are installed.
3. Run `main.py` to see the analysis and projections.

## Contributing
Contributions to enhance the prediction model or improve the data analysis are welcome.
